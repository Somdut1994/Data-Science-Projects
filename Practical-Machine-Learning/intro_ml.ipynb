This is a method that lets us define several transformers that might work on different columns of our feature matrix, and paste those results together into a new feature matrix.  Columns unused in any of the transformers can either be dropped (the default), or \"passed through\", i.e. pasted (unchanged) into the resulting feature matrix.  (For those familiar with it, this is similar to the [`FeatureUnion`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.FeatureUnion.html) in scikit-learn.)

Sparse output is more memory efficient, and it's the default, but other functions may not accept it as input.\n",

    "## Question 5: Logistic Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by building a classifier that uses Logistic Regression.  Practically speaking, this could be very similar to the models that we built before, but we have a new challenge to deal with: our data has missing values.\n",

    "In a different situation, we might want to drop rows or columns, but this often means throwing out good data, and we may not have the luxury of ignoring incomplete observations when the time comes to apply our model.  Here we'll assign a value to each missing field based on the other values in the same column.  We suggest using the [`SimpleImputer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer.html) transformer from scikit-learn's  `impute` module.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the behavior of `SimpleImputer` is somewhat limited.  If we wanted to use a more complicated strategy to impute values (or to use different strategies for different columns), then we'd need to write a custom transformer.  Another strategy to be aware of is filling in random values.  This is a middle ground between imputation and dropping rows/columns.          "

    "## Question 6: Feature Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to gain insight into our machine learning models is to look at how much influence each variable has on their predictions.  In a broad sense, variables with more influence are more important because they have more predictive power.  For example, with linear or logistic regression we can measure importance by looking at the coefficients learned by the model.  If our features were normalized to begin with, then the coefficients with the greatest absolute value correspond to the most predictive features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, we'll use the `.coef_` attribute of `LogisticRegression` to get the coefficients from the estimator we built in the previous step.  Keep in mind that we need to do feature scaling to get a fair comparison of the coefficients, so you may need to modify your pipeline to include `StandardScaler`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then write a function that returns a list of the five most important features, together with their coefficients.  Depending on how you built your estimator, you may need to do some digging to access the `LogisticRegression` component.  The `best_estimator_` attribute of [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) and the `named_steps` attribute of [`Pipeline`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html) may come in handy.
